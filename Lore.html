                    <h2>The Founding of Demacia</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Demacia was born in the aftermath of the Rune Wars, a time when the unchecked use of magic had left much of Runeterra scarred and broken. Survivors of the wars sought refuge from the destruction wrought by sorcery. They discovered petricite, a rare, magic-absorbing stone, which they used to build a fortress deep within the mountains. This sanctuary became the heart of Demacia.

                        Petricite not only protected the people from rogue magic but also symbolized a new beginning—a place where order and justice would reign, free from the chaos of sorcery. Over centuries, this fortress grew into a kingdom, a beacon of hope and safety for those who sought shelter from the dangers of the world.</h4>

                    <h2>Demacian Values and Culture</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Demacia prides itself on its core values:
                        <br>
                        - Honor: Every citizen is taught to uphold truth and integrity above all.
                        <br>
                        - Justice: The rule of law is absolute, and all are expected to abide by it, no matter their station.
                        <br>
                        - Loyalty: Service to the crown and kingdom is seen as the highest virtue.
                        <br>
                        - Anti-Magic Stance: Magic is seen as a dangerous force that caused the horrors of the Rune Wars. Thus, Demacia has strict laws against the practice of magic, and those born with magical abilities often face persecution.
                        <br>
                        The kingdom is highly structured, with a focus on military discipline and duty. Knights clad in shining armor are a common sight, their banners proudly displaying Demacia’s sigil: a soaring bird of prey, symbolizing freedom and vigilance.</h4>
